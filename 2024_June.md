# Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire

- **Steam Page**: [Sky Oceans: Wings for Hire](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691750/Sky_Oceans_Wings_for_Hire/)
- **Total Play Time**: 1 hour, 3 min
- **Will Purchase**: Yes
- **Type**: #adventure #rpg #turn-based    

> 🕹️ **Description**: Indie Skies of Arcadia
> 
> 👍👍 **Feedback**: `Skies of Arcadia` is one of my favorite RPGs. Anyone attempting to replicate it's #turn-based ship combat gets my attention. I was a little unsure cause the combat starts a bit easy and repetitive, but when the enemy attacks and you're scrambling to retreat - and they could take me out in 2 hits.. well it both got tough and rather fun. It had a few "am I supposed to die here cause this boss is overpowered?" moments that.. no you're trying to survive. 
> 
> The story is good too. It starts light-hearted, your friends in the pilot academy are reaching their final exam. There will be a big celebration. But in the backdrop, your dad "died" a few years ago, your mom is a recluse. She misses your pilot graduation and feels bad. The "alliance" empire attacks your town looking for your mom (oh she's hiding something of course) - but she comes to rescue your ass and escape to save the town, so the enemy persues you. 
> 
> As an indie game, it gets a pass on a few critique: I do wish the camera was a bit further back on the character and the character portrait art is fantastic, but clashes with an ever-smiling simple 3D model that just needs to frown occassionally. Maybe that's a WIP. Also `Skies of Arcadia` is really excelent cause it has chracter combat and dungeons as well as aerial combat, and this game is gonna feel a little lacking if its just one. However, you do fly around much faster and engage in monsters with advantage/disadvantage as opposed to random encounters.

# Once Human

- **Steam Page**: [Once Human](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/)
- **Total Play Time**: 33 minutes
- **Type**: #survival #multiplayer

> 🕹️ **Description**: Jank game
> 
> 👎 **Feedback**: When I first saw this I was hyped. It has a cool vibe, somewhere between Control and Stranger Things. But it didn't run well on my machine. And intro melee combat wasn't fun. And it dropped me into survival crafting that... already feels a step behind something like PalWorld (though I've not played). Basically it had a slim chance to be interesting to me. It's not. Nothing spawned in the world though I ran past the "build a x" tutorial is probably why.

# ONE BTN BOSSES

- **Steam Page**: [ONE BTN BOSSES](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/)
- **Total Play Time**: 15 minutes
- **Type**: #action #arcade #indie

> 🕹️ **Description**: Press one button, change direction
> 
> 👍 **Feedback**: You're on a track. Usually a circle, sometimes a line with a teleport at the ends. If you press a button, you change direction but your shooting slows down. The less you press, the faster and more shooty you are and the bosses need to be killed fast. Risk/reward to ride it out a near miss or change tap-tap-tap direction. Fun music

# Dungeons of Hinterberg

- **Steam Page**: [Dungeons of Hinterberg](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/)
- **Total Play Time**: 45
- **Will Purchase**: Yes
- **Type**: #rpg #adventure

> 🕹️ **Description**: Smash together Earthbound, Zelda, Mario Galaxy, Tony Hawk and Persona.. into a good game?
>
> 👍 **Feedback**: Well this game is dope. It's an RPG in the modern world (ala Earthbound), but with magic. You fly around on a magic sword/snowboard, shoot magic beams, fight monsters with a sword, and do dungeon things. The dungeon started as a ski resort and then morphed into a Mario-Galaxy style puzzle planet adventure. Then I returned to the town of Hinterberg with time to kill ala Persona. And it was fun the whole time? Interesting.

> 🕹️ **Description**: Van-life
>
> 👍👍👍 **Feedback**: I love this! Ah, it's like a cozier zelda exploration game with a van. Your sister sends out a distress signal, so you return to your home planet. You're waiting for your dad, so you're slowly reconvening with old friends. The van has attachments like scanning for jammers that block communication. I noticed there was a large under-ground cave system near the starting town to return to later. This is probably my most anticitpated indie game.

> 🕹️ **Description**: Throw things at office workers
>
> 👎 **Feedback**: Pass. Dang.. the vibe is good but the gameplay is meh. As a ghost (dead ex-employee), you fling objects at coworkers to start fights and most mayhem causes most points. Like.. I dunno, destruction golf? And the boss fight was flinging a ghost around. It looked good but was like a.. not that fun mini game.

- **Type**: #puzzle #platformer

> 🕹️ **Description**: Frog jumping from shadows.
>
> 👎 **Feedback**: Mixed. Aesthetic, I love this. But I'm not sure I was having much fun cause "jump shadow to shadow" doesn't have much complexity. I found more complexity in `I am Fish` where I was just rolling a fishbowl. Plus the "story" was weirdly depressing. You're a frog in a human's shadow and you start at let's say 8 years old, then you graduate, then you get a girlfriend, break up, get a job, get fired, then get separated from your frog shadow. I guess the frog shadow represents "happiness" cause your human sure is depressed. Look, it's kinda a cool experience, but I think it gets a pass from me.

# REKA

- **Steam Page**: [REKA](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1737870/REKA/)
- **Total Play Time**: 38+ minutes
- **Will Purchase**: Yes
- **Type**: #crafting #horror?

> 🕹️ **Description**: A crafting (survival?) game but your house is on a giant chicken and you're a witch that controls crows. 
> 
> 👍 **Feedback**: Rumors are there's a witch at the edge of town in the woods. So of course, you do her errands and resurrect a giant chicken house and become her witch apprentice. The Slavic dream is more alive than the American one. I particuarly liked how you command the crows to pick up crafting material. And even though I'm not a crafting/building genre fan, I'll play this one for the atmosphere alone.

> 🕹️ **Description**: Play as a crow
>
> 👍 **Feedback**: Funny game with cute aesthetic and flying/pooping mechanics. Next-fest part caught on fire. A fairly "my first game" vibe, but funny like [Rain on Your Parade](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1213230/Rain_on_Your_Parade/)
