Had to put in my compsci degree to work into getting this to run on linux..

# Space Trucker

I feel like this could be as zen as Euro/American truck sim (except it's WASD and not my wheel) - but oh this is clever. The up-down deminsion and rotate the ship, maglocks, and general traversal of 3D space is clever. The radio and CB is nice. I was not expecting so many systems internal to the cab, but it kinda makes sense. You can die in your truck/ship. Climate went a bit off and cause I didn't figure out how to fix it, I froze to death. I imagine battery, systems management is a larger role, but I think in a fun way. It wasn't exactly expected. The game could use cruise control :P

# Pepper Grinder

What a great demo. Movement is super fun. You can accelerate and coming out of dirt is a little tricky cause you can just fling yourself into death. Avoid spiky traps, bombs, flip switches. Probably the best 2D platformer (outside Mario) I've played in a while.
