# Pepper Grinder

> 20 minutes, must-play

What a great demo. Movement is super fun. You can accelerate and coming out of dirt is a little tricky cause you can just fling yourself into death. Avoid spiky traps, bombs, flip switches. Probably the best 2D platformer (outside Mario) I've played in a while.
