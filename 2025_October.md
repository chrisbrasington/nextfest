# Primal Echo Demo

- **Steam Page**: [Primal Echo Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4060770/Primal_Echo_Demo/)
- **Total Play Time**: 26 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: platformer

> 🕹️ **Description**: Climb the dystopian future
> 
> 👍  **Feedback**: I haven't played [Lorn's Lure](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1417930/Lorns_Lure/) (ah shit there's a demo) - but climbing giant dystopic, metalltic structures has been on my radar in a sort of opposite of [Peak](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/).
> 
> I believe you're born from a mushroom.. like a human construct of what a mushroom thinks a human was like. There's some fruit and birds and "primal" things, but you're traversing an endless metal structures. Very dyson-sphere [Blame! (manga)](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=blame+manga&ia=images&iax=images) vibes. 
> 
> The controls are.. weird, but I kinda get what the 3 indie devs were going for. They're not intuitive but they work. I like how you can die but mostly the mushroom saves you from falls into the void. Doesn't save you falling to the floor I think, but you just revive.. er.. reconstruct?
> 
> I kinda dig it. Unpolished but in a way that makes movement skill based rather than forgiving. 
> 
> I did that it's clearly a metroidvania. There were MANY sprawling pathways that were "OUT OF DEMO" bounds and that was cool. I wound back at the beginning (secret passage) and quit cause I wasn't sure where to go next.

# Beyond the Doors

- **Steam Page**: [Beyond the Doors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2714150/Beyond_the_Doors/)
- **Total Play Time**: 89 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: horror,mystery

> 🕹️ **Description**: ok wtf is behind these doors
> 
> 👍  **Feedback**: First off - I kept crashing the game on day 2 (out of 5) but liked it enough to try to [reach out to the dev](https://steamcommunity.com/app/2714150/discussions/0/500587419683617513/) for support. Running WIP things in linux is suprising it works this well tbh.
> 
> I'm not sure what this game is. I'm in a garbage filled mystery "apartment" building surviving on cheeseburgers and soda. I'm not sure the real world exists outside this building. I'm not sure anyone lives here.
> 
> What I'm doing is getting emails for recordings and I have to physically wire receivers from my basement dwelling to the top floors and record. And seeing how my computer is ONCE AGAIN FROM THE NINTIES IF NOT EARLIER - it takes forever. I could upgrade shit if I could afford it from the money I get from these recordings.
> 
> So far..... the ghosts or whatever are banging and I did get one creepy child laugh for a second. 
> 
> Whatever I'm doing is really f-ing wrong. 
> 
> ...... this demo was so intruiging in that its entire premise is a mystery. Literally the screenshots brought me in and I didn't even read the description.

# Skate Story

- **Steam Page**: [Skate Story](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/)
- **Total Play Time**: 48 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: skateboarding

> 🕹️ **Description**: I too would sign a demonic contract to be made of glass if it were the only way I could skateboard. 
> 
> 👍👍👍  **Feedback**: *heavy breathing*
>  
> Somehow not only is this the a realistic skateboarding game, it's.. philosophical?
> 
> I think you're dead (might have missed something) - but you can skate if you're under contract and turned to glass. Your quest is to eat the moon. It makes more sense than I'm going to try to explain. You wind up battling a philosopher to see the beauty in your skateboarding quest.
> 
> The music is phenomenal, gameplay, atmosphere - everything. So so great.

# Demon Tides Demo

- **Steam Page**: [Demon Tides Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3477260/Demon_Tides_Demo/)
- **Total Play Time**: 112 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: YES
- **Type**: platformer

> 🕹️ **Description**: FANTASTIC PLATFORMER
> 
> 👍👍👍  **Feedback**: I knew of the platformer `Demon Turf` but hadn't played it. That'll change. This is the sequel `Demon Tides` now with 3D character models instead of sprites.
> 
> This game excells in so many things. We're talking rivaling mario here. When you jump, you basically have a double jump + bat glide - it's very long but the jumps are spaced out long too. To get around the world fast, your snake form just f-ing zooms across land and water.
> 
> I love that you can put a checkpoint flag anywhere and warp back. If you get stuck on a particular hard area, you don't have to repeat it. 
> 
> I love how the world is windwaker-open-world with islands akin to Mario Bowser's Fury. 
> 
> This is really, REALLY good.

- **Total Play Time**: 34 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: platformer

> 🕹️ **Description**: silly platformer
> 
> 👎  **Feedback**: unfortunately a dud for me. A silly little indie platformer and good use of music - but didn't hold a candle to last year's `Orbos Exodus` and I just wanted to play `Mario Sunshine` or a demo I hadn't tried yet `Demon Tides`

# No Players Online

- **Steam Page**: [No Players Online](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701800/No_Players_Online/)
- **Total Play Time**: 47 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: horror

> 🕹️ **Description**: More creepypasta PC
> 
> 🫳  **Feedback**: Pretty similar to [Heaven does not respond](#heaven-does-not-respond) in that this is a haunted PC where no one is online and you're downloading random crappy games from a dead forum. Only difference is there's a soul transfer program and seems to be someone trapped in a capture-the-flag game. I was able to combine two unrelated games, a cracked visual novel of a college student and "fishing with knives II" to make a game that had me walking a dog until the game broke. Or I got eaten.
> 
> It's kinda neat and creepy but arbitrarily guessing the next combination the game wanted me to do (I guess glowing means something) - I got stuck. It's possibly non-linear which makes it more like a puzzle - just a puzzle I'm not sure I have patience beyond this.

It's multiplayer focused, so offline the 2 bots do everything. I couldn't see what was going on half the time. It tries to be Vermintide or co-op doom. Meh

> 🕹️ **Description**: Anime nier-adjacent
> 
> 🫳  **Feedback**: 
> 
> Pros: Nier-style gameplay, fun boss fights. Good move-set and parry system. I liked a special that let me ninja zoom across the arena to a boss fight. Nier should add the naruto run
> 
> Cons: If you took out the cool world design of Nier, you'd have an.. "ok" game. The story is basic. "Demons take over humans sometimes". The levels were linear yet I had a guide I didn't need. I could span the parry button without consequence, so timing mattered less than it should. 
> 
> But it was fun enough that I did the boss fight multiple times.

> 🕹️ **Description**: Resident Evil with a twist
> 
> 👍 **Feedback**: Did I just write down "tactics, horror"
> 
> Whoa. Ok before playing, I thought looked too derivative. But that's like thinking `Half-life` and `Abiotic Horror` play the same, when one is a first-person-shooter and the second a survival game.
> 
> `House of Necrosis` is a mystery-dungeon tactics game. Meaning when you move or take a turn, so do all characters. Don't move? World is paused. Being able to look in 3D (straight ahead), aim and shoot 3 spaces away, and use a knife in front - felt really great actually. Some enemies (if you're not swamped) have patters, like `Crypt of the Necrodancer` minus the musical timing. That means if you have an empty room, you can dodge/attack at the right time and take no damage taking them out. 
> 
> The healing spell is straight up `Final Fantasy 7` Aerith healing spell. You can identify serums, use them to warp or petrify (throw) at enemies. 
> 
> The boss was hard, I warped out (item).

> 🕹️ **Description**: A quiet French retreat.
> 
> 👍  **Feedback**: My car broke down in near a quiet little French town. The mechanic won't give it back without $300. Ignoring the pile of cars blocking the exit of the town, I answer a payphone and get entangled in a wee bit entangled with a local conspiracy theorist. I get jailed for stealing a sandwich, I help a lady figure out why her missing person posters are getting ripped down (after beating the guy up). I fail at selling drugs (apparently "Hello fellow narcatics enjoyer" is a cop, who knew). 
> 
> There's a simple level of simulation going on with people's patterns - nothing complex. You can juggle money, health (eat food) - lose "wanted" status by changing clothes - and only so many times you can break out of jail before the brick up the holes in the wall. Game seems like a silly, fun little mystery romp.

# MOTORSLICE

- **Steam Page**: [MOTORSLICE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/)
- **Total Play Time**: 33 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: YES
- **Type**: action

> 🕹️ **Description**: Just a girl in a dystopia making a living with your chainsaw
> 
> 👍👍👍 **Feedback**: I've followed the dev on this one. This is the winner, handsdown. The platforming is slick. The chainsaw is used on yellow walls for "infinite" wall running (up too!), combined with shorter wall running and jumping. The combat is one hit kills. The bosses are metal shadow-of-colossus. This is just fantastic.

Which weirdly put me 4 miles AHEAD of the storm, so I quit.
