> 
> My average words-per-minute is consistently 75-80 WPM but accuracy 98%. My heart rate 100. I HAVE A 1/3 CHANCES OF WINNING ANY ROUND - which is insane for a 20 player battle royale-game. I won multiple times.
> 
> But I make a lot of dyslexic mistakes, and those reset the line. and 3 of those puts a bullet in the gun of russian-roulette. I literally think this game helps my dyslexia typing - I am not even joking. It's like I know see how speaking is going to come out spaeking with my fingers. 
> 
> What's fucked up (aside from the imagry) is there was one of those jumbled sentences with a lot of mistakes, and I could type it "correctly" but the game makes you type it incorrectly - which I could not due. Dude won it at 66 WPM. 
> 
> A lot fo `Scheiße` in voice chat.
> 
> Millenials have an unfair advantage in this game, I AM CERTAIN.

- **Type**: gacha

> 🕹️ **Description**: Gacha - as in, ha gacha to play this stupid game
> 
> 👎  **Feedback**: Pretty garbage
> 
> Mobile port, you just tap J to win. Actually I got confused on a fight not ending cause I realized I was infinitely comboing the enemy. So I went to 1000x combo. I could have quit then. I watched some more missions.
> 
> It's the type of game that has currency associated to "play next level". Utter trash
> 
> I wish it had the gameplay of the last game [Homura Hime](#homura-hime) cause the space/future setting was neat.

# Homura Hime

- **Steam Page**: [Homura Hime](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3201470)
- **Total Play Time**: 37 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: Maaaaybe
- **Type**: action

> 🕹️ **Description**: Anime nier-adjacent
> 
> 🫳  **Feedback**: 
> 
> Pros: Nier-style gameplay, fun boss fights. Good move-set and parry system. I liked a special that let me ninja zoom across the arena to a boss fight. Nier should add the naruto run
> 
> Cons: If you took out the cool world design of Nier, you'd have an.. "ok" game. The story is basic. "Demons take over humans sometimes". The levels were linear yet I had a guide I didn't need. I could span the parry button without consequence, so timing mattered less than it should. 
> 
> But it was fun enough that I did the boss fight multiple times.

# House of Necrosis Demo

- **Steam Page**: [House of Necrosis Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3447260/House_of_Necrosis_Demo/)
- **Total Play Time**: 36 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: tactics, horror

> 🕹️ **Description**: Resident Evil with a twist
> 
> 👍 **Feedback**: Did I just write down "tactics, horror"
> 
> Whoa. Ok before playing, I thought looked too derivative. But that's like thinking `Half-life` and `Abiotic Horror` play the same, when one is a first-person-shooter and the second a survival game.
> 
> `House of Necrosis` is a mystery-dungeon tactics game. Meaning when you move or take a turn, so do all characters. Don't move? World is paused. Being able to look in 3D (straight ahead), aim and shoot 3 spaces away, and use a knife in front - felt really great actually. Some enemies (if you're not swamped) have patters, like `Crypt of the Necrodancer` minus the musical timing. That means if you have an empty room, you can dodge/attack at the right time and take no damage taking them out. 
> 
> The healing spell is straight up `Final Fantasy 7` Aerith healing spell. You can identify serums, use them to warp or petrify (throw) at enemies. 
> 
> The boss was hard, I warped out (item).

- **Total Play Time**: 10 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: survivors

> 🕹️ **Description**: 3D vampire survivors
> 
> 👍  **Feedback**: Yeah I can see why this is popular - it's vampire survivors but 3D. And it does the chest/loot addictive stuff I noticed the last one was missing. MEGABONK does have one interesting mechanic the "bonk"... basicaly some enemies explode and it can fling you across the map. And that can be to your advantage (or not).

> 🕹️ **Description**: FPS slow vampire
> 
> 👎  **Feedback**: This game was slow and dull. It felt like the ethestic was sorta trying to be bioshock, hide from the big daddy. You reload your gun with blood which drains your health. Demo felt "we're working on the big baddie ai, so here's a little town loop. It just wasn't good gunplay?

> I'd much rather play `Witchfire`.

> 👍  **Feedback**: My car broke down in near a quiet little French town. The mechanic won't give it back without $300. Ignoring the pile of cars blocking the exit of the town, I answer a payphone and get entangled in a wee bit entangled with a local conspiracy theorist. I get jailed for stealing a sandwich, I help a lady figure out why her missing person posters are getting ripped down (after beating the guy up). I fail at selling drugs (apparently "Hello fellow narcatics enjoyer" is a cop, who knew).

> There's a simple level of simulation going on with people's patterns - nothing complex. You can juggle money, health (eat food) - lose "wanted" status by changing clothes - and only so many times you can break out of jail before the brick up the holes in the wall. Game seems like a silly, fun little mystery romp.

# MOTORSLICE

- **Steam Page**: [MOTORSLICE](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2830030/MOTORSLICE/)
- **Total Play Time**: 33 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: YES
- **Type**: action

> 🕹️ **Description**: Just a girl in a dystopia making a living with your chainsaw
> 
> 👍👍👍 **Feedback**: I've followed the dev on this one. This is the winner, handsdown. The platforming is slick. The chainsaw is used on yellow walls for "infinite" wall running (up too!), combined with shorter wall running and jumping. The combat is one hit kills. The bosses are metal shadow-of-colossus. This is just fantastic.
