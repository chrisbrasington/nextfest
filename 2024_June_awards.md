# Best Demo

[The Alters](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601570/The_Alters/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251331383771529318

`The Alters` just hooked me in with its scifi setting and all the things that usually don't attract me: base building and survival. I really want to see where this goes.

# Biggest 180

[Demonschool](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251420740583166002

Demonschool didn't attract me with its premise and the combat confused me with multiple deaths. The DEVs on the intro screen did say it was dropping me into chapter 2 and it DID say to READ the combat instructions on the menu. So I did. And I started to understand what I was seeing with this chess-like "setup all the moves" and execute style combat. I really enjoyed the combat.

# Best Story

[Closer the Distance](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991300/Closer_the_Distance/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1252057027161882624

A store about death and grief is going to narratively be a rough time - but this was so well executed - I had to leave the house, treat myself to good meal and just contemplate life. This is a story I need to see follow through.

# Most Innovative

[Blue Prince](https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251967435398185061) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251967435398185061

Somehow taking clue, wrapping it into an exploratory puzzle, maze game.. is really creative. It feels so fitting, like the board-game itself is doing "the game" wrong - but this mystery. This is how its meant to be. 

# Most Surprising - TIE

[FACEMINER](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2276980/FACEMINER/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251667303360102430
[CATO](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1999520/CATO/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1252084944029614271

FACEMINER for being a tedious clicking windows 95 machine that had me caring about math and percentages like a puzzle and had me worrying if I could get just enough money before I overheat to afford the cooler - I was surprised how into breaking this I got. I want to keep going to be a millionaire. Also the constant dark-web chatter about AI and if what we're doing is ethical or legal was really interesting and real.

CATO for just being out of nowhere and so brilliant it made instant sense and fun.

# Most I DON'T WANT TO STOP PLAYING (Matt's suggestion)

[Uncle Chop's Rocket Shop](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1849790/Uncle_Chops_Rocket_Shop/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251790778821509230

Because `Uncle Chop's Rocket Shop` had me dying and failing to repair so many spaceships and I saw A FRACTION an absolutely small amount of the puzzles - I want to master this. I want to pay rent. I want to figure out how to beat this damn game. 

# Funniest

[Tactical Breach Wizards](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251357199691681802 

The premise was already silly, but the banter! The banter at every door breach and every SINGLE start/end of a room - had me in stitches the entire time.

# Worst Demo / Biggest Disappointment

[Once Human](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1251003833446957087

I like the atmosphere.... of the trailer. I hated everything about the gameplay and performance and servers, my god. 

# Best Demo I didn't play

[Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870350/Pipistrello_and_the_Cursed_Yoyo/)

Didn't play it, looks cool.

# Honorable Mention
[Caravan SandWitch](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1582650/Caravan_SandWitch/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1249932999680589864
[Dungeons of Hinterberg](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1983260/Dungeons_of_Hinterberg/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1250918556590145688

It's so weird that `Caravan SandWitch` and `Dungeons of Hinterberg` landed in the middle, cause had I guess, I thought they would have been #1. But they are absolutely excellent. There's so many things I plan to buy out of this, it's crazy. 

# Girfriend Award (couch watching)

[Goblin Cleanup](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2748340/Goblin_Cleanup/) - https://discord.com/channels/270032432747642881/1249870561119830056/1252069072565309450

@tavvyj like when I died in this one a lot
