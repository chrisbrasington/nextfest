fuck picking the "best" one was really hard. I think it goes to [Skate Story](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#skate-story) just because of how unique the graphics, story, music and gameplay were all in one. It was simply mesmerizing.

## Most Pre-Anticipated

  </a>
</div>

[MOTORSLICE](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#motorslice) for sure since I had been watching the dev. I really liked his character animations and managing to be an indie dev with some gameplay mechanics not seen in other games such as wallrunning with a chainsaw "infintely" is really impressive ESPECIALLY for a 3D platformer/action game. So much of that has been done before.

Runner-up: [Demon Tides](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#neon-divide) is so good, I literally had to mention it here. It was most played too.

## Biggest 180 Surprise

<div class="featured-game">
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2005870/House_of_Necrosis/" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2005870/header.jpg?t=1759762809" alt="House of Necrosis">
  </a>
</div>

[House of Necrosis](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#house-of-necrosis-demo) - not because I expected it to be bad, but because I thought it looked too derivative of Resident Evil. So when it started and had entirely different gameplay, being a turn-based tactical game ala mystery dungeon, it threw me way off. It was pretty fun to boot.

## Worst Demo

<div class="featured-game">
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2300120/fa89a77d18796ccbc571f178b67f348b671b529d/header.jpg?t=1761066355" alt="Painkiller">
  </a>
</div>

[Painkiller](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#painkiller). There were some demos I dropped that weren't for me, and there were some I had hopes for and wasn't enjoying - but Painkiller was just disappointing. I want to go back and give the originals a go cause I vaguely remember them - and they're more linear, puzzle-y. Painkiller was a game designed in a fucking board room where people sit around discussing what they think "gamers" want in co-op games. Well it ain't locking rooms for hordes of enemies, that's for sure. It ain't linear design where your team mate hits a switch and you wait (I'm sorry have you even seen the creativity of Split Fiction on doing more than f-ing buttons?)

Runner-up: [Neon Divide](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#neon-divide) is <b>DELISTED</b> trash!

## Most Stressful + Most Replayed

<div class="featured-game">
  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2413950/Final_Sentence/" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/2413950/dd0951a66c786b1a81547af2f7cd055362c9c7f1/header.jpg?t=1760176284" alt="Final Sentence">
  </a>
</div>

[Final Sentence](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#final-sentence-demo) was simple, to the point and brutal. And I kept returning to it. It got maybe 10 different sessions, I might even boot it up again.

## Most Innovative + Best World Design

  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1417930/Lorns_Lure/" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://shared.fastly.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1417930/header.jpg" alt="Lorn's Lure">
  </a>
</div>

[Lorn's Lure](https://github.com/chrisbrasington/nextfest/blob/main/2025_October.md#lorns-lure) - innovative because it came out a year before PEAK - even though now there's a lot of climbing games.
