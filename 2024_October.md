# Metal Bringer

- **Steam Page**: [Metal Bringer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334170/Metal_Bringer/)
- **Total Play Time**: 35 minutes (offers more)
- **Will Purchase**: Yes
- **Type**: action

> 🕹️ **Description**: You awake from cryo-sleep 1000 years to a world where few humans live underground. Grab a mech and hop to trying to find your mom.
> 
> 👍  **Feedback**: You can customize the hell out of your character, colors, attributes, and swords and guns. But you're weak. A mech consists of legs and a head, and two arms and probably more. As you fight other mechs and defeat them, you can swap out any of your parts on the fly. 
> 
> Which is important cause I didn't really watch this and broke my two arms. So I didn't last long without an weapons. So knowing when to use certain ARMS and when to swap is key. But it's a rougelike, so you can just do a run again.
