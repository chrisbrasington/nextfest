# Is this Game Trying to Kill Me

- **Steam Page**: [Is this Game Trying to Kill Me](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2658470/Is_this_Game_Trying_to_Kill_Me/)
- **Total Play Time**: 25 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: puzzle, horror

> 🕹️ **Description**: Play a game at a computer and in your room at the same time.
> 
> 👍  **Feedback**: Similiar to [Suffer the Night](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2176850/Suffer_The_Night/) where you play a computer game. Except this one blends the 2D computer puzzles more with elements in the room. I felt pretty stuck for example not having an UP button (on a DPAD in the game), to realize I had a button outside in the room. It's clear that you go into more rooms and maybe the game changes as you progress. Pretty clever. The deaths are great, when you die in the game (like drowning), you're thrown into the same thing IRL.

# Metal Bringer

- **Steam Page**: [Metal Bringer](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2334170/Metal_Bringer/)
- **Total Play Time**: 35 minutes (offers more)
- **Will Purchase**: Yes
- **Type**: action

> 🕹️ **Description**: You awake from cryo-sleep 1000 years to a world where few humans live underground. Grab a mech and hop to trying to find your mom.
> 
> 👍  **Feedback**: You can customize the hell out of your character, colors, attributes, and swords and guns. But you're weak. A mech consists of legs and a head, and two arms and probably more. As you fight other mechs and defeat them, you can swap out any of your parts on the fly. 
> 
> Which is important cause I didn't really watch this and broke my two arms. So I didn't last long without an weapons. So knowing when to use certain ARMS and when to swap is key. But it's a rougelike, so you can just do a run again.
