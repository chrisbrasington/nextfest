> 🕹️ **Description**: Have you heard of king's field.
> 
> 👍👍👍  **Feedback**: `Queens Domain`, a riff on From-Software's `King's Field` is just phenominal. I know I need to play [Lunacid](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1745510/Lunacid/) and the original games. 
> 
> Indie games like this are nailing the dream-like, almost lost-media aesthetic of PS1-era but well beyond what the system could render and draw distance. All while retaining chunky pixels, an almost gameboy on paper sky rendering (that you can turn off by the way for sharp 100% clarity). It's a vibe, and I dig it.
> 
> The combat is pretty simple and punishing. Charge your sword swing to 100% on your stamina bar for one strike, less damage delt if you release early. Slow and metholdical. Strafe ratbugs. Walk back from chickets. Wait to get a blunt weapon for skeletons. The 3 recharging daggers give you a quick out for finishing enemies or baiting one from a pack. Or killing laser flowers high up in trees. 
> 
> The level design even does the dark-souls, loop back to the beginning thing. And I could see 3 areas I wanted to get to but I didn't have the "flying sword" yet. 
> 
> This demo is so much fun.
