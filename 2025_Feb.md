# Lost in Random The Eternal Die Demo

- **Steam Page**: [Lost in Random The Eternal Die Demo](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3381200/Lost_in_Random_The_Eternal_Die_Demo/)
- **Total Play Time**: 45 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: Likely
- **Type**: roguelike

> 🕹️ **Description**: Lost in random roguelike
> 
> 👍 **Feedback**: Ok - sweet. See unfortunately `Lost in Random` was a brilliant game and a really great alice-in-wonderland world, but I did-not-finish because the combat was too repetitive. It played in the third person and you had to wait to recharge our dice throw and then pick from cards - and I had a lot of times where I had no swords or bad draw. Maybe my deck sucked. But it was painful to go on a long boss fight with some bad draws and have to do it again.
> 
> As a roguelike, I feel the issues I had with combat were finely tuned. You always have a sword. You can throw your dice at enemies for 1-6 damage, you just have to go pick it up. You have one card which is your special and it charges up. This is much, much, much faster. And death is when you upgrade, so less punished. And the final boss is basically Ornstein and Smough. I didn't quite beat them but I will probably return to this demo to do so.

# Hopeless Sea

- **Steam Page**: [Hopeless Sea](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732210/Hopeless_Sea/)
- **Total Play Time**: 5 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: shmup

> 🕹️ **Description**: shmup in the sea
> 
> 👎  **Feedback**: Yeah.. I'm not a big SHMUP person but I'm probably not gonna play the one where I shoot sea turtles instead of spaceships (even if they're shooting at me). Also while funny, giving me 2 achivements for menu buttons to start is kinda immersion breaking. I got 5/7 achivements in 5 minutes and didn't care to get the final 2.

# Is This Seat Taken

- **Steam Page**: [Is This Seat Taken](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/)
- **Total Play Time**: 19 minutes
- **Will Purchase**: 
- **Type**: puzzle

> 🕹️ **Description**: Lite puzzle game
> 
> 👍 **Feedback**: Not difficult. Cute. Don't place smelly people/shapes near people who don't like smells. Or music. Or children. The key is placing the people that have a requirement first, like front row of a movie theater or eating cheese.
